# JavaSchool2018

Hello Java developer!

Here you can find all the examples which you saw in all classes! So be careful with this powerfull repo!

  - Each week, this repo will be updated along the classes
  - If the instructor leaves you homework, you need to send it in the Google Classroom of Java School!
  
### How can I get the code?

It's easy! You only need to click on Clone or Download button
If you clicked on Clone, you need to go to terminal or cmd, create a folder which identifies it's Java School and type
```sh
cd ~/Documents | cd C:/Users/<username>/Documents
mkdir JavaSchool
cd JavaSchool/
git clone <URL>
```
If you choose Download, you only need to decompress that file and that's it!
